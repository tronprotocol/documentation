# TRON Wiki Outline

## Introduction

### TRON：Decentralize Internet Again 

TRON is dedicated to the basic construction and continual promotion of decentralized Internet. TRON protocol is one of the world’s largest decentralized application operation system protocol, which is based on blockchain and provides high-throughput, scalable, and highly-reliable underlying public-chain support for decentralized application. More application scenarios can be supported because of high TPS of TRON public chain, which exceeds tens of thousands. Besides, TRON public chain has greatly aroused enthusiasm of the ecological participants through the way of free using and high incentives. It not only meets the strict requirements of online decentralized entertainment applications that are highly concurrent, low calculation delay, and demanding much data transmission, and also delivers an amazing interactive decentralized user experience. Developers can develop their own and community applications by using TRON protocol and virtual machine. Smart contracts can be used for distributed crowdfunding and digital asset distribution. TRON protocol has been used to operate decentralized applications such as APP, Obike, Uplive, game.com, Kitty live, Mico and so on. The number of active users has exceeded 100 million, with distribution in over 100 countries around the world.

### What is TRON?

TRON operates as a decentralized blockchain platform for supporting smart contract and high throughput. TRON team sees it as a future operation system which allow developers deploying their own decentralized applications.


+ Digital Asset Function with Chain Embedded

     Rather than simply stress "lacking in characteristics”, TRON mainly focus on user-friendliness of different functions. For example, after fully research of current market, the develop team of TRON found that there are many decentralized platform users who do not have programming skills but have rich intrinsic value. They cannot convert their intrinsic value into external entities because of high threshold and versatility of existed smart contract. This is the reason why TRON team embeds custom digital asset functions into the main chain instead of actualizing functions in the form of smart contracts. This can be more easily and directly to achieve a number of indicators such as user-friendliness, safety, and so on.

### The Launch of Testnet

+ TRON Milestone

      2018.3.31 The lanuch of testnet.
      2018.5.31 The launch of mainnet.
      2018.6    ERC20 Token--> Migration completed

  Technical proposal of exchange upgradation (including permanent support) --- Stage 4: Permanent support for exchange.

    Stage 1
    1.	Users transfer TRX (ERC20) to the wallet of exchange.
    2.	Exchange produces public key and private key.
    3.	Exchange provides address data first for TRON foundation. (The matching relationship between Ethereum address and TRON address) 
    4.	TRON foundation makes a manual confirmation of received address data. 

    Stage 2
    5.	Exchange transfers TRX (REC20) to validated account of TRON foundation and informs TRON foundation to start account verification.
    6.	TRON foundation verifies, receives and records TRX (ERC20) of address provided by exchange.

    Stage 3
    7.	Based on the address data received in Stage 1 and the transaction records received in Stage 2, an amount of TRX are euqal proportional to the number of TRX（ERC20）received in Stage 2, that will be sent on the TRON Mainnet.
    
    Stage 4  
    8.      The only exchange will start migration from TRX (ERC20) to TRX regularly. The process is the same as above.

### Web 3.0: Web 3.0: A Decentralized Application Platform

+ Smart contract

+ The Content of Delegated

  The Basic Rule of Consensus
    *  Coin holders are required to vote for nodes in accordance to their tokens that have vote right. And nodes are elected what are known as witnesses based on votes and rules, which keep a balance between block-producing speed and the number of witness.
    -  Meanwhile, voting users and nodes that are voted out will be paid for a certain sum of money for encouraging them to run for further elections.
    -  Witnesses will produce valid blocks successively based on specific distribution rules and success to do so results in highest reward. 
    -  The vast majority of witnesses are chosen by votes and the rest will guarantee to be selected randomly under certain algorithm.

### The TRON Foundation

+ TRON foundation is community-oriented.

## TRON Clients

### Choosing a client

+ Why should I choose Java develop clients?

   TRON enables JAVA development—a programming language that owns the highest number of community members and is highly commercialized. The natural support capability of JAVA’s community is incomparable to others. In order to accomplish the construction of decentralized platform with a more decentralized development model, TRON hopes to effectively mobilize the strength of the community.

+ Multi-Language Support TRON Client in the future

   TRON will support other development languages in the future, including Scala. C++, Python, Go, etc.

+ How should I install on my desktop/laptop?( PC)

### Java-Tron

+ Current status
+ Building from source
+ Installing binaries
+ Contributing
+ Architecture
+ Portability
+ Running

## Account Management

+ Accounts
+ Keyfiles
+ Creating an account
+ Migration

## TRONIX

+ TRON supply
+ Online wallets
+ Paper wallets
+ Sending TRX
+ Operation price

## The TRON Network

+ Connecting to the Network
+ Test Network
+ Setting up a local private testnet

## Validated Witness Packaging

+ Algorithm
+ DPOS VS POS VS POW

     POW always has its downside like high electric power consuming and low TPS caused by low efficient consensus mechanism. Therefore, it won’t fit the outlook of TRON. POS outstands to be the undeniable guideline for TORN in order to be a primary blockchain platform for daily scenes. After fully research of impressive ideas in the field of blockchain, we now know for certain that improved DPOS can be TRON’s consensus to meet our future demands.

## Asset Issue and Trade

+ Asset Issue

     Users can customize their own digital assets through digital asset configuration functions. Types of adjustable parameters include, but are not exclusive to: asset name, abbreviation, LOGO, total capitalization, exchange rate of TRX, starting date, expiring date, attenuation coefficient, controlled inflation model, inflation period and description. System will provide users with default parameter if users don’t set the parameters themselves. Users can choose to issue assets after customizing parameter. (artificial or system default) System comes with operations and functions, and that allow issuers to deploy digital asset, which has already been validated and customized. Customized asset is deployed once witnesses successfully validate, and can be freely circulated on TRON network.

+ The Trade of Customized Asset

+ dAPPs

+ Develop Tools

     API is mainly used for client development. With API support, asset issuance platform can be designed by developers themselves.
