# BUG-BOUNTY

## Introduction

From now on, community members can participate in the Bug Bounty by identifying bugs and reporting them to TRON. TRON Foundation will rate and reward the reports based on the importance of the bug, how hidden the bug is, estimated workload of the discovery, and subsequent workload of communication with TRON. 

Here are some possible ways to find bugs:

* Run full node simulations and identify problems;

* Participate in elections and identify problems;

* Using the blockchain explorer, wallets, and other apps;

* Review TRON's open-source code on Github and identify problems;
