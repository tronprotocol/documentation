# TRON Accelerator(Deprecated)

## Please note this project does not interact with current TRON Accelerator online DApp competition starts from Dec 1st to Jan 5th.

#### Introduction

To show support for the community and expand TRON’s ecosystem, TRON will offer developers USD$100,000 loans to help resolve budget shortage and support subsequent R&D and operations. 

#### Loan Amount & Disbursement

Loan Amount: USD$100,000   

Disbursement: Within 6 – 24 hours  

Disbursement Method: Once eligibility for TRON Accelerator is verified, applicants will receive the equivalent of USD$100,000 in digital assets from the TRON Foundation. After funds are disbursed, TRON will publicize information on participating projects and funding flows on official TRON channels.

#### Repayment

There are currently two repayment methods:

+ If the developer’s project completes a new round of financing, the loan of USD$100,000 will be converted to its equivalent in equity, at 80% of the company’s new valuation amount. [USD$100,000 / (0.80 x New Valuation)]
+ Loans provided through TRON Accelerator will be interest-free for the first 18 months. The  developer shall repay the principal balance of USD$100,000 within 18 months, either in USD or mainstream digital asset equivalent at the time of repayment.

By setting up TRON Accelerator, TRON aims to expand and strengthen its network ecosystem, instead of seeking short-term commercial gains. If projects fail due to force majeure, the developer does not need to repay the principal balance.

#### Application Requirements

+ Developer submits application to the TRON Foundation. Application must include product description and project achievements (including but not limited to product links and APKs).

+ Applicant must verify software ownership.

+ Applications that only provide a project plan and description will not receive a response.

+ Upon approval, qualified applicants will receive funds totaling USD$100,000 in convertible debt.

+ Evaluation standards: The product should be in the demo stage or beyond. Developers should demonstrate rigorous work ethic and the desire for a long-term partnership with TRON to build a community-centric ecosystem.

+ Funding usage policy: Funding must be used to support further project development or operations for the applicant.

+ DApps—finance, payment, gaming, currency, IoT, energy management, social media, communications
