**Dear supporters of TRX,**  
    
   Thank you all for your keen attention and support to Tron.  
   
   For the reason that Tron’s public blockchain main net will be launched shortly, the migration from ERC20 tokens to TRX, the cryptocurrency on Tron’s public blockchain, will begin on 2018, June 21, GMT. We highly recommend exchange that all transactions be frozen from June 22 to June 23. After June 24, ERC20 will no longer be valid for transactions, for we will only support transactions with TRX on the public blockchain.  
   
   For token holders, with your ERC20 tokens saved to cryptocurrency exchanges (the only required operation on your part), further operations for token migration will be automatically completed for you in due time.  
   
   For exchanges, it is kindly requested that you post your notice of TRX migration as soon as possible, with the format of the technical transition file: https://github.com/tronprotocol/Documentation/tree/master/TRX  
   
   For further information or support, all exchanges are welcome to contact us at trx@tron.network.

**Tron Foundation**
