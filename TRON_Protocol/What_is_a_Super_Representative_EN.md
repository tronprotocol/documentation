## Super Representative Recommendations  

Every token holder has the opportunity to become a TRON Super Representative. However, for the network and community to operate more smoothly and effectively, we have created a set of standards and regulations for eligible candidates to become recommended Super Representatives. We will promote recommended SRs to increase their chances of being elected.
New recommended Super Representatives are updated and posted once a week.
